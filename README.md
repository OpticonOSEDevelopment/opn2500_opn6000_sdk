# Applications

In the folder `Projects/Applications`, 2 applications can be found that are installed on the OPN-2500 / OPN-6000 by default. They provide a good starting point when only small customizations are required:

## BatchApplication
    -> Batch application to demonstrate using the OPN as batch device and communication using USB-MSD and OseComm

## BluetoothAppl
    -> Bluetooth application to demonstrate Bluetooth BLE Serial, HID and OptiConnect as well as USB-HID, USB-CDC and USB-VCP and memorizing

## Snippets
    -> Source files used by both applications for storing, updating and exporting bar code data in the file system

- Open the projects file: `BatchApplication\Projects\ses\Batch_Appl.emProject` or `BluetoothAppl\Projects\ses\Bluetooth_Appl.emProject`

- After building, the resulting .bin file can be found in the root folder of the applications and loaded using Appload

- The User Manuals of the OPN-2500 and OPN-6000 in the SDK provide more information on how to use these applications

# Examples

In the folder `Projects/Examples`, you'll find small example applications for all basic peripheral functions of the OPN-2500 / OPN-6000 
    
- Open the projects file: `OPN_Examples.emProject` in Segger IDE

- In the `Project explorer`, right click the source files and use the `Exclude from build` option to select which sample application to build.

- After building, the resulting `.bin-file` can be found in the `/Output folder and loaded using Appload

# Loading of Firmware

- See `/documentation/How to load Firmware.pdf` for more information on how to load the resulting .bin files on to the OPN-2500 / OPN-6000

# Trouble Shooting

By default, the OPN will have the USB-VCP COM-port enabled, which makes it possible to load firmware using Appload over USB. 
In application where this COM-port is not enabled (i.e. USB-MSD) or when the application has crashed, use this method to enter firmware update mode:

- Press and hold both the trigger and function key for at least 15 seconds. 
- After the companion scanner LED turns white, release the function first to enter firmware update mode.
- If successful, the LED of your companion scanner should now be blinking red. 

You should now be able to load new firmware using Appload or OptiConnect. 
To exit firmware update mode, press both keys for 3 seconds (or wait 30 seconds).

# OptiConnect

OptiConnect is a free application developed by Opticon to configure and manage the OPN series of barcode scanners and your bar code data that is available on all platforms.

To connect your OPN to the OptiConnect app:
1. Download and install the OptiConnect app from your app store or go to [OptiConnect](https://opticonnect.opticon.com) (available for iOS, Android, Mac OS and Windows).
2. Make sure the OPN-6000 is set to BLE mode by scanning the label in the quick start guide.
3. In OptiConnect, go to ‘Pair Scanner,’ and select the discovered ‘OPN-6000’ or 'OPN-25000' to connect

A Flutter SDK is available for mobile app developers to use the OptiConnect functionality in your own application:
[opticonnect_sdk_flutter](https://github.com/OpticonOSEDevelopment/opticonnect_sdk_flutter)

# OptiConfigure

Opticon barcode readers can be customized using configuration barcodes. All available configurations for each device can be found here: 

[OptiConfigure for OPN-6000](https://opticonfigure.opticon.com/configure?scanner=OPN6000)
[OptiConfigure for OPN-2500](https://opticonfigure.opticon.com/configure?scanner=OPN2500)

The SystemSetting()-function in the SDK makes it possible to use these configurations in your own application.

<code>int SystemSetting( const char *option_string );</code>

Note that 3-letter menu codes should be prefixed with the character '['. Likewise, 4-letter menu codes should be prefixed with the character ']'. 

### Example: 
<code>SystemSetting("[BCM");  // BCM: Enable all 1D codes excl. add-on</code>

# Porting existing applications

When porting applications of the OPN-200x, PX-20 and RS-3000 please note the following differences

## New Features in OPN-6000 / OPN-2500

- **BLE OptiConnect service** (BLE and USB)
- **Bluetooth Device Firmware Update (DFU)** (via OptiConnect)
- **Bluetooth BLE HID supported** (replaces Bluetooth Classic HID)
- **Both USB-VCP (default) and USB-CDC driver are supported**
- **Bluetooth, Batch, and OPN2001 application merged into a single default application**
- **New defaults (default firmware):**
  - **OPND**: OseComm data collector mode (previously Batch application + ‘C01’)
  - **BPC**: Switch to USB-CDC (Serial scanner mode)
  - **BQZ**: Switch to USB-CDC (OPN2001 mode)
  - **U2**: OPN-2001 default

## Removed / Missing Features from OPN-6000

- **Bluetooth Classic (HID/SPP) is not supported**
- **Scanning of Bluetooth address labels to connect is removed** (BLE is always slave)
- **Setting of Pin code not supported**
- **NetO protocol is no longer supported** (OseComm is recommended as alternative)

## Changed Default Behaviour (Bluetooth Application)

- **Bluetooth BLE HID is set as factory default**
- **Discoverability** Device becomes discoverable when pressing the trigger key
- **Memorizing** (when not connected) is enabled by default
- **Memorizing option**: 'Trigger to send' is enabled in BLE HID and USB-HID mode
- **Keyboard toggle on iOS** is now enabled by default
- **'Trigger to connect(able)’ uses function key**, not the trigger key
- **OPN6000 automatically switches into OPN2001 mode** after receiving an OPN2001 interrogate command
- **Manual reset** by pressing both keys for 15 seconds results in white LED. Release the function key to enter bootloader mode.
- **Device can enter sleep mode in all connection statuses** (except when connected to USB), greatly improving battery life when connected to Bluetooth.
- **Function key can be used to remove barcodes** when connected to OptiConnect (and when memorizing)
- **Default Bluetooth local name is OPN6000_(serial)** instead of OPN6000_(MAC Address), because mobile platforms often hide the Bluetooth address nowadays for privacy reasons.

## File System / Database Functions

- **The Bluetooth, Batch, and OPN2001 application are merged** into a single default application and store their data in the same format.
- **Switch between all applications without losing data.**
- **Barcode data is stored in two files**:
  - `SCANNED.DAT`: barcode data
  - `SCANNED.IDX`: quantity, serial, date, & time
- **The batch application generates the CSV file** with the configured formatting as soon as the USB-cable is connected instead of while scanning.
- **USB-MSD file system is now 'read/write'** instead of 'read/only' (file system corruption by Windows is resolved).
- **The OPN-6000/OPN-2500 uses ChaN's FatFS filesystem**, which uses functions like `f_open` and `f_close` (from `ff.h` and `FileSystem.h`).
- **For backwards compatibility**, `stdio.h` functions like `fopen` and `fclose` are supported using a wrapper.
- **Low-level I/O functions** `open`, `close`, `read`, `write` are no longer supported.

## Source code
- If your application is derived from the OPN-2006 Batch or Bluetooth application, it is recommended use the new Batch/Bluetooth application as starting point to add your customizations
