<H1>Reading barcodes</H1>

<P>
The handheld terminals can read all major barcode types and some special ones. By default all major barcode types can be read.<BR>
A large number of parameters are available to influence the way barcodes are being read.
They are listed in the section: <A HREF="../Systemsetting/Systemsettings.html">Systemsettings</A>,
and can be set with the <A class=clib HREF="../functions/SystemSetting.html">SystemSetting()</A>
function. Options exist for setting which barcode types must be read, if a check digit
must be calculated on the barcode or not, and extra formatting of the barcode.
Setting only the barcode types used in your application is good practice, since it
reduces the probability of false reads.
</P>

<H3>1. Barcode scanner specifics.</H3>

<P>
For the laser terminals and 2D CMOS scanners, other options exist that influence the performance of the scanner. They are also listed in the <A HREF="../Systemsetting/Systemsettings.html">Systemsettings</A>-section
of this help file and can again be set by using the <A class=clib HREF="../functions/SystemSetting.html">SystemSetting()</A> function.
The redundancy setting specifies how many times a barcodes must be decoded in a row,
before it is accepted as a valid read. By default it is set to two. Setting this value
lower will make the scanner more aggressive, but false reads may become somewhat more likely.<BR>
The scan-engine is the part of the handheld terminal that emits the laser beam, detects
variations in reflected laser light and stores this information in a buffer for further
processing by the <A class=clib HREF="../functions/ReadBarcode.html">ReadBarcode()</A> function.
The scan-engine can be controlled from the application by the
<A class=clib HREF="../functions/ScannerPower.html">ScannerPower()</A> function.<BR>
After the handheld terminal reads a barcode the scan-engine will be switched off or continue
reading ("multiple read"), depending on which parameters were passed to
<A class=clib HREF="../functions/ScannerPower.html">ScannerPower()</A>.
The scan-engine must be seen as an independent process running concurrently with the
application and regulated by <A class=clib HREF="../functions/ScannerPower.html">ScannerPower()</A>.<BR>
The function <A class=clib HREF="../functions/ReadBarcode.html">ReadBarcode()</A> tries to find a barcode in the scan-engine data.
If <A class=clib HREF="../functions/ReadBarcode.html">ReadBarcode()</A> finds a valid barcode, it returns the barcode, else it returns an error code.<BR>
It is important to understand that <A class=clib HREF="../functions/ReadBarcode.html">ReadBarcode()</A> must be called repeatedly, in a loop,
to yield a barcode. Each time <A class=clib HREF="../functions/ReadBarcode.html">ReadBarcode()</A> is called, it processes the scan-engine data
generated so far and then returns. In this respect it is much like getchar() on an stream,
that neither waits for a keystroke, but returns immediately.
