<H1>File system</H1>

<H3>General</H3>

<P>
The file system emulates a disk drive in RAM. The file system has a flat directory structure,
like in MS-DOS version 1.00. The file names are in MS-DOS 8.3 format, that is from 1 to 8
characters for the name, and 3 characters or less for the extension.
The maximum number of files that can exist in the file system is 50. The maximum number
of files that can be open at the same time is 17, plus stdin, stdout and stderr.<BR>
The file system does not store time and date information.<BR>
There is not a hard-coded boundary between memory used for the file system and memory
used for the memory pool. The file system and the memory pool share the same memory space.
The advantage is that memory can be allocated to files or allocated to the application by
malloc() exactly as needed.<BR>
When a file is stored in the file system, blocks are dynamically allocated as the file
is growing. Each block has a fixed size, the default 'sector' size of the RAM disk.<BR>
Because of the dynamic nature of the file system it relies heavily on malloc().
This also means that the file system can be corrupted, when malloc() and free() are
used incorrectly. So, the application developer is advised to be careful when
using free() and malloc().
