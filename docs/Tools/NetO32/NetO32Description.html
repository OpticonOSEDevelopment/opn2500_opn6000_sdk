				NetO is the standard protocol that is implemented on the whole Opticon hand
				held terminal range. With this protocol an Opticon Terminal can send or receive
				files from a host device (PC). The host (PC) is the device that takes the
				initiative by sending a small poll command to the terminal(s) with a specific
				ID. The terminal can respond if the poll command ID matches the ID of the
				terminal or if the poll command sends the broadcast ID. When the terminal
				responds to the Poll command it will tell the host that it wants to send or
				receive files. The host will then start the up or download if that is possible.
				The get a safe transfer of the file some check are included in the transfer to
				see if anything goes wrong. When the transfer of the file is completed a new
				file will be on the terminal or on the host.
