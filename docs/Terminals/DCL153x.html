			Both models of the DCL15xx terminals have their own Operating System version that can be distinguished by an unique 3 letter code (starting with 'LB').
			Before you try to load a new Operating System on a DCL15xx you have to know which Operating System file (i.e. LBKVxxxx.S32 for the DCL1530) must be loaded on your terminal.
			In the table below you can find which software code belongs to which DCL15xx terminal.<BR>
