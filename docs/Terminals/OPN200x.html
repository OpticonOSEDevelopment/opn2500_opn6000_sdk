			All OPN2002 and OPN2003 terminals run an OS (operating system) and an application. Both the OS and the application can be loaded

			The OPN200x terminals use an Operating System version that contains an unique 3 letter code.
			Before you try to load a new Operating System on an OPN200x terminal you have to know which Operating System file (i.e. RBFVxxxx.S2) must be loaded on your terminal.
			In the table below you can find the software codes for the OPN200x terminals.<BR>

			To be able to communicate with the OPN200x terminals using USB, you will need to have its USB driver installed on your PC. This driver can be found on our web site on the 'Service and Support' page.<BR>

			After downloading the USB Drivers installer run the downloaded executable and follow the instuction. <BR>
			<BR>
			After installing the USB driver, you can connect your OPN2002 or OPN2003 to USB using the mini-USB cable. Windows will then automatically install a virtual COM port on your
			PC, which can be selected in various applications, like <A HREF="../Tools/Appload.html">appload</A>, Hyperterminal and Neto32.<BR>

			To load a new OS or application onto the OPN2002, you'll need a mini-USB cable (which is supplied with the OPN2002) or <A HREF="../Cradles/CradleOPN200x.html">CRD2000</A> multi cradle and follow

						<B>Loading software with multiple OPN2002s in the cradle</B><BR>
						<P><I>
							IMPORTANT: Be aware that the <A HREF="../Cradles/CradleOPN200x.html">CRD2000</A> can NOT load software on multiple OPN2002s simultaneously, because only one OPN2002 can communicate to a PC at the same time!
							<BR>
							Since all terminals in a CRD2000 cradle will be able to receive the data that <A HREF="../Tools/Appload.html">Appload</A> is sending to the cradle,
							but the OPN2002s can't tell whether they are currently muted or not, the loading of software will go wrong for all OPN2002s
							in the CRD2000 cradle besides one. The end result would be OPN2002s with faulty software that will need to be restored by loading
							the software again (one at a time). See the <A HREF="../Terminals/OPN200x.html#TroubleShooting">trouble shooting</A> section for more information about
							loading software on OPN2002s with faulty or crashing software.
						</I></P>
						<P><I>
						However, a new download protocol has been added to the OPN2002 that makes sure that only one OPN2002 will start downloading software
						at the same time when using the CRD2000 cradle. This feature has been added in OS version RBGV0207,
						so please verify that your OPN2002s have at least this OS version installed.<BR>
						Also make sure that you are using <A HREF="../Tools/Appload.html">Appload</A> version 1.39 or higher (with LoadDLL EGF34096 or higher), because the old
						versions of <A HREF="../Tools/Appload.html">Appload</A>	didn't support this new protocol yet.
						</I></P>

						- Read the important note above.<BR>
						- Place up to 10 OPN2002s in the cradle.<BR>
						- Start <A HREF="../Tools/Appload.html">Appload</A> and select the COM port of the <A HREF="../Cradles/CradleOPN200x.html">CRD2000</A> cradle.<BR>
						- Select the OS or application file in <A HREF="../Tools/Appload.html">Appload</A>.<BR>
						- To be sure that all OPN2002s have been updated, wait till Appload has finished downloading the software on all OPN2002s.<BR>
						<BR>
						<I>Note: The OPN2002 that is currently being updated will be recognizable by its orange LED, so never remove this OPN2002
						from the cradle during the downloading of the software.</I><BR>

			Since the OPN200x doesn't have a display, it also doesn't have a <A HREF="../Appl-development/Sysmenu.html">system menu</A> to resort to when you've installed a crashing application that prevents you from
			loading new software on the OPN200x.<BR>
			<BR>
			For this reason the OPN200x has a few escape mechanisms to allow you to restart, halt your application and/or install new software. This can be very useful in case the OPN200x has crashed or is constantly restarting due to
			a crashing application.<BR>

					<TD>
						The OPN200x has a watchdog timer to determine whether the OS is still running or has crashed. This watchdog will cause the OPN200x to restart after about 3 seconds if the OS has crashed.
						This watchdog timer will not cause a restart when only the application has crashed.
					</TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD>Manually</TD>
					<TD>
						The OPN200x has a manual restart mechanism that allows you to restart in situations that the OS is still running, but your the application has crashed. In order to activate
						this mechanism, press and hold the trigger or delete key for at least 20 seconds. After the OPN200x has sounded the restart beep, you can release the key to complete the restart.
