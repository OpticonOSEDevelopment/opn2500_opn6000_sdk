			The OPN-2500 and OPN-6000 run a combined Bootloader, OS, Softdevice and application, which can be loaded as a single file

			The OPN terminals use an Operating System version that contains an unique 3 letter code.

			Since the OPN doesn't have a display, it also doesn't have a <A HREF="../Appl-development/Sysmenu.html">system menu</A> to resort to when you've installed a crashing application that prevents you from
			loading new software on the OPN.<BR>
			<BR>
			For this reason the OPN has a few escape mechanisms to allow you to restart, halt your application and/or install new software. This can be very useful in case the OPN has crashed or is constantly restarting due to
			a crashing application.<BR>

					<TD>Automatic</TD>
					<TD>
						The OPN has a watchdog timer to determine whether the OS is still running or has crashed. This watchdog will cause the OPN to restart after about 3 seconds if the OS has crashed.
						This watchdog timer will not cause a restart when only the application has crashed.
					</TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD>Manually</TD>
					<TD>
						The OPN has a manual restart mechanism that allows you to restart in situations that the OS is still running, but your the application has crashed. In order to activate
						this mechanism, press and hold the trigger and delete key for at least 15 seconds. After the OPN shows a WHITE led, you can release both keys to complete the restart.
