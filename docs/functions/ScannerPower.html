		<TD class=itemdescr>
			This function controls the power of the scan engine in the handheld terminal.
			The scan engine can be switched on continuously, switched on only when the user presses the
			trigger key, or switched off.
			The selected power mode remains active, even when a barcode is read and the scanner is
			switched off. The next trigger press will re-enable the scan engine. Call this function with
			OFF, to completely disable the scan engine.

			mode can have one of the following values:

			<TABLE class=OPTIONS width=100% >
				<TR>
					<TD>OFF</TD>
					<TD>The scan engine is switched off immediately.</TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD>ON</TD>
					<TD>The scan engine is switched on immediately, and switched off when "time*20" ms has elapsed.</TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD>SCAN_TRIGGER</TD>
					<TD>The scan engine is switched on when the user presses a trigger key. The scan engine stays powered for as long as the user presses the trigger key and "time*20" ms hasn't elapsed.</TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD>SCAN_SINGLE</TD>
					<TD>The scan engine is switched on when the user presses a trigger key. The scan engine stays powered regardless of the state of the trigger key, and is only switched off when "time*20" ms has elapsed, or when a successful read has been made by <A class=clib HREF="./ReadBarcode.html">ReadBarcode()</A>.</TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD>SCAN_MULTIPLE</TD>
					<TD>
						Almost the same as SCAN_SINGLE, however the scan engine is not switched off
						after a successful read by <A class=clib HREF="./ReadBarcode.html">ReadBarcode()</A>,
						allowing the user to read another barcode. However, the same barcode can only be read
						when the scan engine has been moved away from the label first. The scan
						time specified by time is reset after a successful read.<BR>
					</TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD>SCAN_CONTINUOUS</TD>
					<TD>
						The scan engine is switched on when the user presses a trigger key.
						The scan engine stays powered regardless of the state of the trigger key,
						and is only switched off when "time*20" ms has elapsed without a successful
						read made by <A class=clib HREF="./ReadBarcode.html">ReadBarcode()</A>.<BR>
					</TD>
				</TR>
			</TABLE>
			<BR>
			The following combinations are also supported
			<TABLE class=OPTIONS width=100% >
				<TR>
					<TD>SCAN_TRIGGER | SCAN_SINGLE</TD>
					<TD>Same as SCAN_SINGLE, but the scan engine is also turned off when the trigger is released.</TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD>SCAN_TRIGGER | SCAN_MULTIPLE</TD>
					<TD>Same as MULITPLE, but the scan engine is also turned off when the trigger is released.</TD>
				</TR>
				<TR>
					<TD>SCAN_TRIGGER | SCAN_CONTINUOUS</TD>
					<TD>Same as SCAN_CONTINUOUS, but the scan engine is also turned off when the trigger is released.</TD>
				</TR>

			<BR>
			<H5><SPAN class=c-keyword>int</SPAN> <I>time</I></H5>
			The time parameter specifies the time that the scan engine is on in steps of 20 milliseconds.<BR>
			Example: time = 100 specifies that the scan engine is on for 20*100 ms = 2 seconds.<BR>
			time = 0 is interpreted as zero time. The scan engine is not switched on in this case.

			The scan engine is the part of the terminal that emits the laser beam or
			LED light and that processes variations in reflected light. When the laser beam is visible
			or the LED is emitting, the scan engine is on; otherwise it is off.
