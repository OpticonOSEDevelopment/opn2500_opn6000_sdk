		<TD class=item>Auto baudrate</TD>
		<TD class=itemdescr>
			When the CRD1001 is set to 'autobaudrate', the PC controls the setting of
			the CRD baudrate controller. In order to be able to do that, the PC uses
			the DTR and RTS lines. The procedure to set the baudrate is shown below:<BR>
			<BR>
			<LI>First pull DTR and RTS high.</LI>
			<LI>Reset the CRD1001 baudrate controller by pulling RTS low and high again.</LI>
			<LI>To select the required baudrate, the DTR line is cycled the requisite number
				of times while RTS remains high. Each time the DTR line is cycled
				(pulled low, pulled high) this causes the baudrate to cycle the list
				above. (See the pulses column)</LI>
			The minimum delay is 15 ms, so keep the level of RTS/DTR steady for at least 15ms.

			<A NAME="CRD1002"><H3>CRD1002</H3></A>
			The CRD1002 is a charging and modem cradle for the OPH1004. The cradle is equipped 
			with two slots in order to charge both the terminal and a spare battery. Data is 
			transmitted to a remote host through a dialup connection via a normal telephone 
			cable.<BR>
			<BR>
			The CRD1002 is equipped with an IrDA interface allowing data transfer when the 
			scanner is inserted for charging. OPH1004 applications that wish to communicate with 
			remote hosts over the dialup connection must use the TCP/IP library, provided in 
			this kit.

			The CRD1003 is a charging and GSM modem cradle for the OPH1004. The cradle is equipped 
			with two slots in order to charge both the terminal and a spare battery. Data is 
			transmitted to a remote host through a cellular data connection to the Internet. 
			The CRD1003 must be provisioned with an active SIM card to make a cellular data 
			connection.<BR>

			<A NAME="CRD1004"><H3>CRD1004</H3></A>
			The CRD1004 is a charging and communication cradle for the OPH1003 with a built-in 
			Ethernet interface. It provides similar functions as a cradle with serial interface
			combined with an ECB1000 Ethernet Converter Box. Towards the terminal it simulates
			an analog modem for internet access using the PPP protocol.
			<BR><BR>
			The CRD1004 also has an USB interface. Using this interface the 
			cradle can be configured and its firmware can be upgraded. It can also be 
			operated as an USB-serial cradle. This enables the user do e.g. download new software into the terminal.
