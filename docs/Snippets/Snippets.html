<P>
Starting a new program from scratch is the most difficult thing about programming.
Even with a very good documented programming manual the first application is the most
difficult. That is why some commonly used functions that have been tested
over the years are put in this snippets section. The snippets are ANSI C snippets.
Also the functions from the Opticon C-Library are clickable to get more information
about the specific function. The functions in this snippets section have all a small
example on how to use the functions. All sources are also included.

			Creating a perfectly working database with all its required functions for adding, reading,
			deleting and searching of records is always a very time consuming process.
			Therefore this section all sorts of functions needed to add a complete barcode database
			implementation into your application.
